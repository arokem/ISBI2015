                 software project for the analysis of data from diffusion
                 magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) experiments. dMRI is an
                 application of MRI that can be used to measure structural
                 features of brain white matter. Many methods have been
                 developed to use dMRI data to model the local configuration of
                 white matter nerve fiber bundles and infer the trajectory of
                 bundles connecting different parts of the brain. Dipy gathers
                 implementations of many different methods in dMRI, including:
                 diffusion signal pre-processing; reconstruction of diffusion
                 distributions in individual voxels; fiber tractography and
                 fiber track post-processing, analysis and visualization. Dipy
                 aims to provide transparent implementations for all the
                 different steps of dMRI analysis with a uniform programming
                 interface. We have implemented classical signal reconstruction
                 techniques, such as the diffusion tensor model and
                 deterministic fiber tractography. In addition, cutting edge
                 novel reconstruction techniques are implemented, such as
                 constrained spherical deconvolution and diffusion spectrum
                 imaging (DSI) with deconvolution, as well as methods for
                 probabilistic tracking and original methods for tractography
                 clustering. Many additional utility functions are provided to
                 calculate various statistics, informative visualizations, as
                 well as file-handling routines to assist in the development
                 and use of novel techniques. In contrast to many other
                 scientific software projects, Dipy is not being developed by a
                 single research group. Rather, it is an open project that
                 encourages contributions from any scientist/developer through
                 GitHub and open discussions on the project mailing list.
                 Consequently, Dipy today has an international team of
                 contributors, spanning seven different academic institutions
                 in five countries and three continents, which is still
                 growing.",

                 powerful tool for studying biological tissue
                 microarchitectures in vivo. Recently, there has been increased
                 effort to develop quantitative dMRI methods to probe both
                 length scale and orientation information in diffusion media.
                 Diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) is one such approach that
                 aims to resolve such information based on the
                 three-dimensional diffusion propagator at each voxel. However,
                 in practice, only the orientation component of the propagator
                 function is preserved when deriving the orientation
                 distribution function. Here, we demonstrate how a
                 straightforward extension of the linear spherical
                 deconvolution (SD) model can be used to probe tissue
                 orientation structures over a range (or ``spectrum'') of
                 length scales with minimal assumptions on the underlying
                 microarchitecture. Using high b-value Cartesian q-space data
                 on a rat brain tissue sample, we demonstrate how this
                 ``restriction spectrum imaging'' (RSI) model allows for
                 separating the volume fraction and orientation distribution of
                 hindered and restricted diffusion, which we argue stems
                 primarily from diffusion in the extraneurite and intraneurite
                 water compartment, respectively. Moreover, we demonstrate how
                 empirical RSI estimates of the neurite orientation
                 distribution and volume fraction capture important additional
                 structure not afforded by traditional DSI or fixed-scale
                 SD-like reconstructions, particularly in gray matter. We
                 conclude that incorporating length scale information in
                 geometric models of diffusion offers promise for advancing
                 state-of-the-art dMRI methods beyond white matter into gray
                 matter structures while allowing more detailed quantitative
                 characterization of water compartmentalization and
                 histoarchitecture of healthy and diseased tissue.",

                 of white matter from combinations of simple models for the
                 intra- and the extra-axonal spaces. We devise a new diffusion
                 MRI protocol that provides measurements with a wide range of
                 imaging parameters for diffusion sensitization both parallel
                 and perpendicular to white matter fibres. We use the protocol
                 to acquire data from two fixed rat brains, which allows us to
                 fit, study and compare the different models. The study
                 examines a total of 47 analytic models, including several
                 well-used models from the literature, which we place within
                 the taxonomy. The results show that models that incorporate
                 intra-axonal restriction, such as ball and stick or CHARMED,
                 generally explain the data better than those that do not, such
                 as the DT or the biexponential models. However,
                 three-compartment models which account for restriction
                 parallel to the axons and incorporate pore size explain the
                 measurements most accurately. The best fit comes from
                 combining a full diffusion tensor (DT) model of the
                 extra-axonal space with a cylindrical intra-axonal component
                 of single radius and a third spherical compartment of non-zero
                 radius. We also measure the stability of the non-zero radius
                 intra-axonal models and find that single radius intra-axonal
                 models are more stable than gamma distributed radii models
